ðŸŽ® Mini-Memory Game

Welcome to the Mini-Memory Game
This is a fun and simple card memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created as a way to recover 
and rebuild the original game concept after the original project files were lost. Despite the setback, this version 
serves as a fully playable and visually appealing remake.

Project Background:
The original version of the Memory Game was unfortunately lost due to unexpected data loss.
Instead of giving up entirely on it, I decided to recreate the game using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to preserve the 
idea and practice my front-end development skills.

This mini version focuses on:
1) Lightweight design

2) Simple and enjoyable gameplay

3)Responsive interface for accessibility on both desktop and mobile

Game Features:
-Card Flipping Animation: Smooth animation in flipping cards to reveal images.

-Memory Challenge: To win, all pairs must be matched.

-Restart Option: The game can be restarted at anytime.

-Simple Yet Clean UI: Easy to understand and play.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 â€” Game structure

CSS: Styling, layout, and animations

JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity
